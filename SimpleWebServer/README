========
Notable Features:
-Support Multiple Connections
-GET and HEAD requests for any content types.
-200, 301, 400, 404, 500, 501 error codes.

Security Component:
Implemented a white-list (".htaccess"). If an IP is listed in the white-list, all connections from that IP will be allowed. Otherwise, any connection from any other IP will be rejected.*

State-fullness:
Implemented HTTP cookies. When a client connects to the web-server they are given a cookie. As a client interacts with the server, that cookie is updated to exhibit changes in state.*

*More details and a thorough explanation can be found in the Design Documentation in the Documentation folder.

Testing:
-Run bash script to launch server with default configuration.
-Request in browser localhost:8000/HM1.jpg
-Request using POSTMAN extension for Chrome HEAD same file.
-To get 500 Error launch Main with flag -failPostTo500 and make POST request to server
-To get 301 redirect specify a url with droids/ in the name as a directory. This will redirect to the droids image.
-To get 400 use utility to send malformed request.
-To get 404 request file not in www directory.
-To get 501 use POSTMAN to send request not GET or HEAD

-To test the multiple connections functionality, it is a bit more difficult. You must have multiple computers making requests simultaneously to server. This can be seen in the console output. With what is being requested by each user.
